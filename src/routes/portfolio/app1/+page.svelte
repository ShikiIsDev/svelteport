      title="Flutter App"
      description="This is my first app made with flutter. Flutter is a cross platform mobile app programming language. It is different from Java that is taught in android app development module in Year 2 Semester 1. This is different as it uses a technique called Scaffolding where an element is created and you specify its functions inside it is quite similar to web development but at the same time it was challenging to understand the concept of how to write elements. This is just a simple task list app as I have yet to master flutter and I made it using android studio."
