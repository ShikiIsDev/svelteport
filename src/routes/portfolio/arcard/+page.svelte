      description="This is a project I made in C337 module using vuforia. Vuforia is a technology used for augmented reality and I found it fun making this card. This app is used to detect an image and show a 3d image. This project sparked a passion in me to pursue learning augmented reality and I hope to make interesting projects with my new found passion of Augmented reality."
