      description="This is another one of my drawing projects where I drew my favourite anime character from One Piece. I made this drawing as Luffy is the main character in the anime and he is my favourite character. I incorporated a different pose to make the drawing look fun and I used the self made font to make the drawing look even more interesting. I want to use what I learn here into applying my creativity into the designing of visually appealing and fun websites."
