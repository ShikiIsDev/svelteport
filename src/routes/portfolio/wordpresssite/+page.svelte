      title="Wordpress Site"
      description="I made this site in Word Press in C219 last semester. It was an interesting experience learning how to use wordpress but I found it more challenging than making a website from scratch ironically. However I still learnt something how web design and it gives me ideas on creating a website maker that is an improvement to wordpress so this experience was still rewarding."
